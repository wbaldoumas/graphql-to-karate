## üéØ About The Project

Automagically generate Karate API tests from your GraphQL schemas. Useful for test-driven development, change validation in CI/CD, and more.

## üì¢ Demonstration

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45316999/233819219-5149e02d-649f-4c3d-a3fd-844a231cf515.mp4

### ‚ú® Features

Here are some features that this tool provides:

- **Generate API tests from GraphQL schemas:** Karate API test generation for both Query and Mutation operations is supported.
- **Filterable Query and Mutation operations:** Allows you to filter down and generate tests for a specific subset of target operations.
- **Validate response codes and response shapes:** Validates response codes and response schemas using Karate [schema validation](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#schema-validation).
- **Handles cyclical type relationships:** Prunes cyclical types to remove cycles as they are encountered.
- **Supports custom scalar types:** Custom scalar types may be optionally mapped to their corresponding Karate schema types.
- **Generates test data for arguments and input types:** Test data for query arguments and input types is generated automatically.
- **Interactive and non-interactive CLI modes:** Supports both interactive and non-interactive CLI modes, as well as JSON configuration.

See the full list of available options below for more information.

## Installation

### üì• Binary Releases

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/wbaldoumas/graphql-to-karate/releases) and download the latest binary for your specific platform. If a binary for your platform is not available, see the [Package Manager](#-package-manager) or [Building From Source](#-building-from-source) sections below.

### üì¶ Package Manager

`graphql-to-karate` is also available as a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/graphql-to-karate) offering and can be installed with the following command:

```sh
dotnet tool install --global graphql-to-karate --version 0.1.0
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Building From Source

To build from source, clone the repository locally and run some flavor of the following command. Be sure to update `<runtime identifier>` to your target platform. A catalog of available runtime identifiers can be viewed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).

```sh
dotnet publish src/GraphQLToKarate.CommandLine/GraphQLToKarate.CommandLine.csproj \
  --configuration Release \
  --runtime <runtime identifier> \
  --output ./publish \
  --self-contained true \
  --force \
  /p:PublishReadyToRun=true \
  /p:PublishSingleFile=true \
  /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=false
```

Once published, you can move the binary to your preferred install location to use.

## üåå Usage

To use `graphql-to-karate`, simply invoke the `graphql-to-karate convert` command, passing your GraphQL schema file as an argument:

```sh
graphql-to-karate convert my-schema.graphql
```

By default, you will be walked through conversion in an interactive way within the CLI.

A `--non-interactive` option as well as [JSON configuration](https://github.com/wbaldoumas/graphql-to-karate/blob/main/configuration/schema/v1/schema.json) are also available (see full [Command Options](#-convert-command-options) below), which may be useful in CI/CD environments.

### üìñ Examples of Non-Interactive Invokation

#### Using Command-Line Options

```sh
graphql-to-karate convert my-schema.graphql \
  --non-interactive \
  --base-url "https://my-api.com" \
  --custom-scalar-mapping DateTime:string,Long:number,Float:number,URL:string \
  --query-operation-filter Users,UserById \
  --output-file some-api.feature\
```

This flavor of `graphql-to-karate` usage is used within CI/CD validation for this repository, where a mock GraphQL server is spun up, `graphql-to-karate` converts the GraphQL schema to a Karate API test, and then the generated Karate API tests are run. Check it out [here](https://github.com/wbaldoumas/graphql-to-karate/blob/main/.github/workflows/integration-test.yml).

#### Using a JSON configuration

```sh
graphql-to-karate convert my-schema.graphql --non-interactive --configuration-file config.json
```
